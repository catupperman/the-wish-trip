## Contributions
> Team 'We Thought We'd Lost Our Minds!' John-Mark Sackett, Kira Griffitt, and Catherine Upperman.  This was an over whelming project for beginning web developers, such as ourselves, however, we were able to build something through all the frustrations. It may not be much, but we plan to continue to work through this project together over the next few weeks to make it the best we can.  We would like to thank our TA's Andrew and Ross for always supporting us whenever we had a question or concern, and our teacher Dan for being the cheerleader from his newly found rolling chair. 
## Testing
> To test the data base we used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to run the different, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. We ran ```npm run develop``` in the terminal multiple times to test the webpage, to ensure the look and functionality were there. Once we had enough content, we pushed to heroku for deployment.
